ðŸš¨ **IMPORTANT WARNING & DISCLAIMER** ðŸš¨

This project, TrafficGuardian, was created partly "for the memes," especially concerning its capability to crash bots using a zip bomb. The use of this software, particularly the zip bomb functionality, is **entirely at your own risk** and is **strongly discouraged for any serious or production applications.**

**Specific Warning Regarding the Zip Bomb Feature:**
The zip bomb functionality within this project is designed to potentially crash systems (such as those operated by bots) by delivering an extremely compressed file. Activating this feature can lead to:
* Crashing the system that attempts to process the zip bomb.
* Unintentional damage to third-party systems, for example, if a bot operates from a compromised system (a "slave computer"), thereby crashing that unsuspecting party's computer.
* Potentially other unforeseen negative consequences.

**Disclaimer of Liability:**
* The author(s) and contributors to TrafficGuardian are **in no way responsible or liable** for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, data loss, system crashes, damage to hardware or software, business interruption, or other financial or personal losses) arising from the use, misuse, installation, operation, or inability to use this software, even if the author(s) have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
* This software is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement.
* By downloading, cloning, compiling, installing, using, modifying, or distributing this software, you explicitly agree that you, as the user, bear **full and sole responsibility** for all actions taken with this software and for any and all consequences thereof.
* It is strongly advised not to deploy the high-risk components of this software (such as the zip bomb) in a production environment, against systems you do not explicitly own or have permission to test, or in any manner that could cause harm to others or violate legal frameworks.

**Think carefully and act responsibly.** This project is primarily intended for educational, experimental, or satirical ("meme") purposes. Be aware of the potential impact of your actions.
